 Internship Task 1 â€“ Interview Questions & Answers

 1. What is an open port?
An open port is a network port that is configured to accept packets. It allows external devices to establish a connection with services running on the machine.

 2. How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?
Nmap sends SYN packets to ports. If a SYN-ACK is received, the port is open. If RST is received, the port is closed. It's a stealthy scan as the TCP handshake is not completed.

 3. What risks are associated with open ports?
Open ports can expose services that may have vulnerabilities. Attackers may exploit these to gain unauthorized access or cause disruptions.

 4. Explain the difference between TCP and UDP scanning.
TCP scanning involves sending SYN or ACK packets and expecting a response, whereas UDP scanning sends UDP packets and waits for ICMP errors or no response. TCP is connection-oriented, UDP is connectionless.

 5. How can open ports be secured?
By disabling unused ports, using firewalls, enabling intrusion detection, and updating services regularly.

 6. What is a firewall's role regarding ports?
A firewall filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on rules. It can block or allow traffic on specific ports to protect systems.

 7. What is a port scan and why do attackers perform it?
A port scan checks which ports are open on a system. Attackers use it for reconnaissance to find vulnerabilities and entry points.

 8. How does Wireshark complement port scanning?
Wireshark captures network traffic in real time. It helps analyze packets sent during scans to understand protocols, detect anomalies, and verify scan behavior.
