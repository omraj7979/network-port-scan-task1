Task 1: Local Network Port Scanning using Nmap


# Task 1: Local Network Port Scanning using Nmap

##  Objective:
To identify open ports in the local network using Nmap and understand network exposure points.

##  Tools Used:
- Nmap (Network Mapper)
- Wireshark (for packet analysis)
- ifconfig (to identify local IP range)

##  Methodology:

1. Checked local IP address using `ifconfig` on Metasploitable machine.
   - Local IP: `192.168.29.213`
   - Interface: `eth0`

2. Performed a TCP SYN (stealth) scan from Kali machine to Metasploitable using:
   ```bash
   nmap -sS 192.168.29.213
   ```

3. Captured packets using **Wireshark** to monitor TCP SYN, SYN-ACK, and RST responses.

4. Identified open ports from Nmap results and documented the findings.

##  Security Insights:

- Numerous open ports and legacy services (e.g., Telnet, FTP, RMI) expose the target to severe security risks.
- Port hardening and service auditing are critical to prevent unauthorized access.

---

##  Outcome:

- Understood how to scan a target system on a local network.
- Identified real-time open ports and verified packet flow using Wireshark.
- Learned practical reconnaissance techniques in a controlled lab environment.
